# Game 01

Let M be a not empty set of integer numbers, find the first subset of 2 numbers of M which sum N. For instance, let's say we've got a set of numbers [2, 5, 8, 14, 0] and N = 10, the resulting subset should be [2, 8].

## Challenge
You're required to create a function that receives an array (M) and integer value (N). This function has to return an array of the first possible solution.

 # Solution
- The solution of this game has been done in PHP (v 7.3.24)
- Within the game-01 directory, the solution-game1.php file has been created, where the proposed solution is found.
- A function called getArrayFirstPossibleSolution has been created that receives two parameters, an array and an integer greater than zero. In this function some validations have been performed according to the requirement.
- At the end of the solution-game1.php file there are some commented examples for testing.
